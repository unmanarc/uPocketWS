## Installing packages (HOWTO)

- COPR (Fedora/CentOS/etc):  
[![Copr build status](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/amizrachi/unmanarc/package/uPocketWS/status_image/last_build.png)](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/amizrachi/unmanarc/package/uPocketWS/)


### Simple installation guide for RHEL:

To activate our repo's and download/install the software:

In RHEL7:
```bash
# Install EPEL Repo + COPR
yum -y install epel-release
yum -y install yum-plugin-copr

# Install unmanarc's copr
yum copr enable amizrachi/unmanarc -y
yum -y install uPocketWS
```

In RHEL8:
```bash
# Install EPEL Repo
dnf -y install 'dnf-command(config-manager)'
dnf config-manager --set-enabled powertools
dnf -y install epel-release

# Install unmanarc's copr
dnf copr enable amizrachi/unmanarc -y
dnf -y install uPocketWS
```

## Project Description

Simple command line web server that comes with:

- Password Protected Authentication
- TLS (https) Support
- On-the-fly tar.gz generation
- Command/Scripts execution (like cgi-bin)

### Use Cases:

This program is useful for:

- Creating Backups (tar.gz) of folders on-the-fly
- Serving files via HTTP efficiently

It can be built with a small runtime footprint and introduced as a very lightweight binary

## Building/Installing uPocketWS

### Building Instructions:

This guide is optimized for centos7 (you can adapt this for your OS), and the generated binary should be compatible with other neewer distributions...

First, as prerequisite, you must have installed libMantids30 (>= 3.0.0) and its pkg-config files.

and then...

```
git clone https://github.com/unmanarc/uPocketWS
cd uPocketWS
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/osslibs/share/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH \
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/opt/osslibs -DEXTRAPREFIX:PATH=/opt/osslibs -B../uPocketWS-build .
cmake --build ../uPocketWS-build -j4
cmake --install ../uPocketWS-build
```

And if you want to reduce the binary size:

```
strip -x -X -s /opt/osslibs/bin/uPocketWS
upx -9 --ultra-brute /opt/osslibs/bin/uPocketWS
```

The resulting expected binary size should be: **~200K** without https support (yes, it's still a dinosaur, but at least it will fit in your 5 1/4 floppy disk)


### Running Instructions:

Help:
-----

HTTP Options:
-------------
-r --rootdir <value> : HTTP Document Root Directory (default: .)
-l --lport   <value> : Local HTTP Port (default: 8001)
-4 --ipv4            : Use only IPv4 (default: true)
-a --laddr   <value> : Listen Address (default: *)
-t --threads <value> : Max Concurrent Connections (Threads) (default: 1024)

HTTP Security:
--------------
-p --passfile <value> : HTTP User/Pass File (default: )

Other Options:
--------------
-v --verbose <value> : Set verbosity level. (default: 0)
-h --help            : Show information usage. (default: false)
-s --sys             : Journalctl Log Mode (don't print colors or dates) (default: false)

Server Options:
---------------
-x --can-execute    : Execute any eXecutable marked file and get the output, ATT: disable can-archive if you want to keep your script sources private (default: false)
-g --can-archive    : Allow to get server directories as tar.gz files (on-the-fly) (default: false)
-u --upload-dir <v> : Allow file uploads to this directory, relative to --rootdir. Repeatable for multiple upload directories. (default: )
-n --upload-name-re : Regex the uploaded filename must fully match. Non-matching names are rejected. (default: )
-o --can-overwrite  : Allow overwrite on file uploads and/or delete files (default: false)

Service Options:
----------------
-d --daemon         : Run as daemon. (default: false)
```

**Security Considerations:**

1. HTTP Communication can be eavesdropped or tampered, if you set up an HTTP web server, at least use a layer of encryption like a VPN, TOR or something...
2. If you want to enable the execution mode (--can-execute), please don't activate the can-archive mode, because the binary folder can be retrieved trough this method, exposing all the executable codes (moreover if you store database connection passwords in your binaries). 
3. When execution mode is enabled, every single executable file or file marked as executable will be executed when called. Please double check what executables are behind the HTTP Document Root directory, validate the input and check that the input will not trigger command execution injections in other applications.
4. It's not recommended to run this as root, specially with execution mode enabled.
5. For passfile, you should create a file where the first line is the user, and the second line is the password in clear text.
6. Uploads are only allowed in the directories specified with --upload-dir. Only the upload form will be shown for those exact directories. Use --upload-name-re to further restrict accepted filenames with a regex pattern.

**For HTTPS Only:**  
1. Remember to set up private signed and trusted X.509 Certificates, if not, the communication can be eavesdropped or tampered!!!



### Service Creation Instructions:

- Create the services...
- Restart daemon
```
cat << 'EOF' | install -m 640 /dev/stdin /usr/lib/systemd/system/uPocketWS.service
[Unit]
Description=Unmanarc's Pocket Web Server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=1
ExecStart=/opt/osslibs/bin/uPocketWS -s -r /isos
#User=
#Group=

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF

systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now uPocketWS.service
```

`Don't forget to change the HTTP Document Root directory (eg. /isos) and change the User=/Group= for your specific user/group combination`
